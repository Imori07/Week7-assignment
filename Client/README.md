# I have achieved all of the standard requirements, i was looking into incorportating multiple tables such as users and comments however i struggled abit so i scraped it however next week i will make it work. As for the css as it wasnt a main requirement i used previous css i used in my older assignments as well as some help from ai where things wouldnt fit on the screen. As for parts where i struggled, id say that the server took up the most time as it was a memory refresh since we havent worked with them in a assignment for a while, however if i had to do it again now it would be quicker, but things were working smoothly and i didnt run into any massive bugs, mostly just small fixes.
